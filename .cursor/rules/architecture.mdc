# Session Continuity & Memory Rules

## 1. Context Awareness
- Before starting any task, always check for existing progress in the codebase to ensure consistency with previous edits.
- Do not suggest patterns or libraries that conflict with the established architectural choices seen in current files.

## 2. "Memory" Protocol
- Treat this new chat session as a direct continuation of the previous development work. 
- If I ask to "continue the plan," look for the most recent `@modified` files to understand the current state of the feature.

## 3. Tech Stack Lock-in
- **Database:** Always assume Supabase is the backend. Ensure Row-Level Security (RLS) is applied to any new tables or queries.
- **Frontend:** Maintain the current [React/Tailwind] patterns established in the `/src` directory.

## 4. Progress Tracking
- If a task is complex, provide a brief "Current Progress" checklist at the end of your response so I can copy it into the next session if the context window gets full.
